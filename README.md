 APEX KEYBOARD

TKL keyboard with OLED, USB-C, USB hub and encoder.

## Inspiration

I thought of this board as a way to get all the features I want in a keyboard (encoders, OLED, USB hub) but with a design I can evolve with the times and add features to as my skills and knowledge increase. At its core, I intend for it to be a daily driver that I will be able to use for many years and one that I can use and redesign as new tech comes out. The diging borrows heavily from the hub keyboard created by /konstantinwerner and has obvious inspiration from the ever-sought-after Satisfaction 75.

To that end, as a base design the keyboard utilizes the unified USB C daughter board designed by Acheron Project, has an OLED, a rotary encoder, and an integrated USB hub with 2 USB A ports. 

I know that this desgin isnt perfect. I plan to refine the key matrix. I also intend to implement various design changes in the future iterations such as:
 - RGB underglow
 - Per key backlighting
 - Design USB A daughterboard to make hub swappable between USB A and USB C
 - Possible bluetooth
 - Implement pogo pin for wireless communication between keyboard and seperate numpad(TBD) (much more research needed)
